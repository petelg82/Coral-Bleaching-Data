# **Global Coral Bleaching Data**


---
This data repository contains a public dataset along with instructions of how to manipulate it for a particular outcome. This data repository is intended for one who is looking to research the effects of our climate on coral reef environments globally. The data is found in a repository funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) called [BCO-DMO](https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/773466).


## **Contents and Source**


---

This repository contain a single python notebook that gives instructions on how to create a subset of data from the raw global coral bleaching dataset that contains the sites in the Atlantic Ocean with a mean temperature over 302.15 degrees Kelvin (29 degrees Celsius)


* Note that in order to download this Python notebook you will need to have a Google Drive account
* The Python Notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nMsS05bNzz8i-NhhZlGrUptB9BgrykL5?usp=sharing)

This repository contains 2 csv files that can also be found in the Data folder


*   [global_bleaching_data.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w51og8CfP_Q-5Ov89z3_o3DRoBFeZrgR/view?usp=sharing) contains the raw global bleaching dataset from BCO-DMO
*   [TooHotAtlantic_Subset.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5illrr4bidbGfRCCm7N4o9Fu132ROVx/view?usp=sharing) contains the a filtered version of the dataset above that just shows the rows from the Atlantic Ocean that have a mean temperature over 302.15 degrees Kelvin

## **Purpose**
 Coral is one of the most temperature sensitive organisms in the world, so this data is a good depiction of climate change going on in the world. This data provide researchers with data on how climate change is affecting our environments. With all of this data enviornmentalists can put pressure on governments and general populations to combat climate change and restore ocean enviornments to save them from possible extinction and an array of negative ecological outcomes.

## **Future Applications of Data**

Researchers can take this data and filter it to specific regions of study so they can compare the data to past and future data collected on coral bleaching and ocean temperatures. This will allow researchers to see the growth of the impact of climate change on coral reefs. Additionally, researchers can take the rates of ocean bleaching and see how they have effected the rest of the enviornment by comparing it to data on other organisms in the area.
